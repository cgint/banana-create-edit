### Type Safety (MANDATORY)
- **ALL functions MUST have complete type annotations** for parameters AND return values
- Use `-> None` explicitly for functions that don't return values
- NO untyped functions allowed - mypy will catch and reject these

### Quality Assurance Workflow
- **MANDATORY: Run `./precommit.sh` after any non-trivial changes or additions**
- All quality checks must pass before committing:
  - mypy (type checking)
  - ruff (formatting/linting) 
  - pytest (tests)
- Fix type errors immediately when they appear
